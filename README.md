# ParellelComputing
“Sorted in 60 seconds”

The goal of this project is to practice writing fast multithreaded codes. The task of this project is to implement parellel quick sort using Pthreads. Implemented parallel quick sort on spark compute nodes(spark cluster operated by ODU CS department) using Pthreads. Sorted two instantiations of this sequence : 
An array of 3 Billion 8-byte doubles. Target time is below 60 seconds.
An array of 6 Billion 4-byte ints. Target time is below 90 seconds.
